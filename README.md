The number of social media users such as twitter users are increased very rapidly. 
This is due to the easiness of publishing feeds (e.g., opinion on political matters, news about any incidents….etc.) in real-time.
However, not always all these tweets are coming from a genuine source, for the past years, there are numbers of fake accounts have been created in order to publish fake news, wrong information and figures…etc. 

The purpose of this project is to detect abnormal twitter’s fake account from real-time tweet streams using Apache Storm and Python programming
